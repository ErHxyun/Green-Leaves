		"title": "About Little Green Leaves",
		"intro": "Established in 2016, the Little Green Leaves Volunteers began with a simple yet profound wish: to ensure that left-behind children in rural areas are not just fed and clothed, but also understood and cherished.",
		"orgTitle": "Our organization",
		"orgP1": "In our early days, we mobilized communities to donate used books and clothing, establishing library corners in village schools and orphanages. As we grew—catalyzed by the PBIC competition and our resilience during the pandemic—we launched the \"Green Leaves Dream Platform\" initiative. This marked our evolution from providing material aid to nurturing the soul.",
		"orgP2": "Over the past decade, countless acts of kindness have converged here. What started as a student initiative has grown into a trusted platform of love. We have channeled nearly 800,000 RMB in charitable support, facilitating long-term, one-on-one sponsorships for over 140 impoverished and \"left-behind\" children. For us, these are not just numbers; they represent the young lives illuminated by hope. With a founding team rooted in Psychology, Little Green Leaves Volunteer understands that for left-behind children, emotional isolation is often harder to bear than material poverty. Our core mission is to protect their mental health and well-being.",
		"virtualTitle": "Virtual Connections",
		"virtualP1": "Through online lectures and interactions, we break the physical barriers of the mountains and broaden the children's horizons.",
		"campTitle": "On-Site Camps",
		"campP1": "During holidays, our volunteers travel to the mountains to host camps. Through real hugs and face-to-face interaction, we send a clear message to every child: You are never forgotten.",

		"leaderEdu": "B.A. in Psychology and Data Science, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)",
		"leaderBio": "Inspired by a dream that began in 2016, Wang Yining founded Little Green Leaves. As a psychology student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), he integrates his academic training into philanthropy and advocates for a dual approach: supporting both material needs and emotional well-being. Over nearly a decade, he has led the team from book and clothing drives to a mature one-to-one sponsorship system—providing companionship and psychological care to help left-behind children in remote mountain areas build a bridge to a wider world."
