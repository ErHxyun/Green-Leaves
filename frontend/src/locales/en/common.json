		"title": "About Little Green Leaves",
		"intro": "Established in 2016, the Little Green Leaves Volunteers began with a simple yet profound wish: to ensure that left-behind children in rural areas are not just fed and clothed, but also understood and cherished.",
		"orgTitle": "Our organization",
		"orgP1": "In our early days, we mobilized communities to donate used books and clothing, establishing library corners in village schools and orphanages. As we grew---catalyzed by the PBIC competition and our resilience during the pandemic---we launched the \"Green Leaves Dream Platform\" initiative. This marked our evolution from providing material aid to nurturing the soul.",
		"orgP2": "Over the past decade, countless acts of kindness have converged here. What started as a student initiative has grown into a trusted platform of love. We have channeled nearly 800,000 RMB in charitable support, facilitating long-term, one-on-one sponsorships for over 140 impoverished and \"left-behind\" children. For us, these are not just numbers; they represent the young lives illuminated by hope. With a founding team rooted in Psychology, Little Green Leaves Volunteer understands that for left-behind children, emotional isolation is often harder to bear than material poverty. Our core mission is to protect their mental health and well-being.",
		"virtualTitle": "Virtual Connections",
		"virtualP1": "Through online lectures and interactions, we break the physical barriers of the mountains and broaden the children's horizons.",
		"campTitle": "On-Site Camps",
		"campP1": "During holidays, our volunteers travel to the mountains to host camps. Through real hugs and face-to-face interaction, we send a clear message to every child: You are never forgotten.",

		"leaderBio": "Inspired by a dream that began in 2016, Wang Yining founded Little Green Leaves. As a psychology student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), he integrates his academic training into philanthropy and advocates for a dual approach: supporting both material needs and emotional well-being. Over nearly a decade, he has led the team from book and clothing drives to a mature one-to-one sponsorship system providing companionship and psychological care to help left-behind children in remote mountain areas build a bridge to a wider world."
